## [The Pile](projects/pile/)

The Pile is a large, diverse, open source language modelling data set that consists of many smaller datasets combined together. The objective is to obtain text from as many modalities as possible to ensure that models trained using The Pile will have much broader generalization abilities. 

The Pile is now complete! Check it out here.
