## Projects


### Large Language models

## {class="content-block"}
- #### GPT Neo
    - ![alt](../../images/project_gpt_neo_image.png)
    - GPT-Neo is the name of our codebase for transformer-based language models loosely styled around the GPT architecture. One of our goals is to use GPT-Neo to replicate a GPT-3 sized model and open source it to the public, for free. 
- #### GPT NeoX
    - ![alt](../../images/project_gpt_neox_image.png)
    - GPT-Neo is the name of our codebase for transformer-based language models loosely styled around the GPT architecture. One of our goals is to use GPT-Neo to replicate a GPT-3 sized model and open source it to the public, for free. 

## {class="content-block"}
- #### The Pile
