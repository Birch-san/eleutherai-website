AlphaFold2 is a deep learning algorithm that leverages techniques originating in natural language processing to do protein structure prediction. It was announced by DeepMind in 2020 at the [CASP 14 competition](https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/) where it stunned the competition with its performance. Although the creators have given several talks and presentations on the algorithm (see, e.g., [here](https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/doc/presentations/2020_12_01_TS_predictor_AlphaFold2.pdf)) the model along with several implementation details have not been publicly disclosed. The AlphaFold2 replication project aims to recreate this model and release it to the public.
