# Get Involved

We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels. Joining EleutherAI is as simple as joining us on Discord and picking a project to contribute to. However we have some areas where we are particularly interested in recruiting experienced collaborators:

GPT-Neo is looking for people with expertise in ML pipelining and developing ML apps with user-friendly UIs.

The Pile is looking for people with access to high-quality data or the ability to scrape, clean, and process large-scale data sources.

The Radiation Lab is looking for people who are experienced with working with fine-tuning and working with the loss landscapes of generative models.

As an independent organization, we are dependent upon donations for our computing costs. We are always interested in speaking with people who can donate compute times.
