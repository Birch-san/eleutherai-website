## About Us

EleutherAI (/iˈluθər eɪ. aɪ/) is a grassroots collection of researchers working to open source AI research. Founded in July of 2020, our flagship project is GPT-Neo, a replication of OpenAI's massive 175B parameter language model, GPT-3. Our Discord server is open and welcomes contributors of all backgrounds.
