## About Us

EleutherAI (/iˈluθər eɪ. aɪ/) is a decentralized grassroots collective of volunteer developers, engineers, and researchers focused on AI alignment, scaling, and open source AI research. Founded in July of 2020, our flagship project is the GPT&#8209;Neo family of models designed to replicate those developed by OpenAI as GPT&#8209;3. Our Discord server is open and welcomes contributors.
