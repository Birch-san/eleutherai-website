EleutherAI (/iˈluθər eɪ. aɪ/) is a decentralized grassroots collective of volunteer researchers, engineers, and developers  focused on AI alignment, scaling, and open source AI research. Founded in July of 2020, our flagship project is the GPT-Neo family of models designed to replicate those developed by OpenAI as GPT-3. Our Discord server is open and welcomes contributors.
